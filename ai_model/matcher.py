ai_model.matcher

Performs vector similarity matching between a new cat image embedding and
a database of known embeddings using cosine similarity and Euclidean distance.

Functions:
    - match_embedding(query_embedding, db_embeddings): Returns the closest match or none.
Constants:
    - THRESHOLD: Distance threshold for determining a match.
