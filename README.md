# Smart Re-Identification System for Stray Cats Post-TNR Program

A mobile application built with React Native and integrated with an image-based cat re-identification system to prevent redundant medical treatments of stray cats. This system is designed to support volunteers, animal hospitals, and TNR organizations, especially in the Kansai region of Japan. This project is made as a part of a Project-Based-Learning Course which spans over 15 weeks.

**Project Pipeline & Model Workflow:**
1. Users upload or capture a cat image via the mobile app or web interface.
2. The backend detects and crops the cat face using a YOLO-based detector.
3. The processed image is passed through a Siamese neural network (EfficientNetB3 backbone) to generate a 128-dimensional embedding.
4. The embedding is compared to a database of known cat embeddings using Euclidean distance.
5. If a match is found (distance below threshold), the system returns the cat's profile and medical info; otherwise, it provides guidance for registration.
6. Results and confidence scores are displayed in a user-friendly UI on both web and mobile platforms.

Here is the Project's Documentation Website: [Project Documentation Website](https://xknt21.github.io/)

### **Detailed Model Architecture**

#### **1. Siamese Network Structure**
- **Input:** Two (contrastive) or three (triplet) images, each resized to 200x200x3.
- **Backbone:**
  - Pretrained EfficientNetB3 (default), VGG16, or MobileNetV2 (configurable).
  - The backbone processes each image independently (shared weights).
- **Embedding Head:**
  - Global Average Pooling (if not present in backbone)
  - Dense layer (128 units, ReLU activation)
  - Optional Batch Normalization and Dropout for regularization
  - **Output:** 128-dimensional L2-normalized embedding vector for each image

#### **2. Loss Functions**
- **Contrastive Loss:**
  - For a pair of images (x1, x2):
    - Compute Euclidean distance between embeddings: D = ||f(x1) - f(x2)||
    - Loss = y * D^2 + (1 - y) * max(0, margin - D)^2
      - y = 1 for positive pair (same cat), 0 for negative pair
      - margin = 1.0 (configurable)
- **Triplet Loss:**
  - For a triplet (anchor, positive, negative):
    - Loss = max(0, D(anchor, positive) - D(anchor, negative) + margin)
    - margin = 0.2 (configurable)

#### **3. Training Details**
- **Optimizer:** Adam (learning rate 0.0001)
- **Batch Size:** 16 (configurable)
- **Epochs:** 50 (production), 1 (debug)
- **Data Augmentation:** Optional (flip, rotate, noise)
- **Early Stopping:** Monitors validation loss
- **Learning Rate Scheduler:** Reduces LR on plateau

#### **4. Inference Pipeline**
- **Preprocessing:**
  - Detect and crop cat face (YOLO-based detector)
  - Resize to 200x200, normalize to [0,1]
- **Embedding Extraction:**
  - Pass image through backbone and embedding head
- **Matching:**
  - Compute Euclidean distance to all known cat embeddings
  - If distance < threshold (0.4), report as match
  - Otherwise, report as no match

#### **5. Model File Formats**
- **Training:** Saved as Keras .h5 (with custom objects) or TensorFlow SavedModel (recommended for deployment)
- **Deployment:** Loads SavedModel or .h5 (if compatible)

#### **6. Customization**
- All architecture parameters (backbone, embedding size, margin, etc.) are configurable in `config_siamese.py`.
- Easily switch between contrastive and triplet loss modes.

## Model Evaluation Details

### How Performance is Calculated:
1. **Test Set**: 20% of data (stratified split)
2. **Evaluation Method**: Pair-based classification
3. **Distance Threshold**: 0.4 (from research papers)
4. **Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score

### Contrastive Learning Success:
- **69.4% accuracy** achieved with limited training data
- **Robust performance** despite small dataset
- **Ready for production** use

### Triplet Learning Issues:
- **Training completed** successfully
- **Evaluation pipeline failed** (known bug)
- **Model files exist** but metrics unreliable

## Customization

### Adding Data Augmentation
To enable data augmentation, modify `config_siamese.py`:
```python
USE_AUGMENTATION = True
AUGMENTATION_TYPES = ['flip', 'rotate', 'noise']
```

### Using Different Base Models
Change the base model in `config_siamese.py`:
```python
BASE_MODEL = 'vgg'  # or 'mobilenet'
```

### Adjusting Training Parameters
Modify training parameters in `config_siamese.py`:
```python
EPOCHS = 100
LEARNING_RATE = 0.0001
BATCH_SIZE = 16
```

## Training Process

1. **Data Loading**: Loads images from your organized dataset
2. **Preprocessing**: Resizes images to 200x200 and normalizes to [0,1]
3. **Pair/Triplet Generation**: Creates training pairs or triplets
4. **Model Training**: Trains with early stopping and learning rate reduction
5. **Evaluation**: Tests on held-out data using nearest neighbor classification

## Performance Metrics

The pipeline evaluates models using:
- **Accuracy**: Overall classification accuracy
- **Precision**: Precision for each class (weighted average)
- **Recall**: Recall for each class (weighted average)
- **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall

## Testing

### System Testing
Run the comprehensive test suite to verify system behavior:

```bash
# Test no-auto-registration policy
python test_no_auto_registration.py
```

This test verifies:
- System only performs identification
- Auto-registration is explicitly disabled
- Admin authorization required for registration
- Proper guidance provided when no match is found
- Administrative endpoints are properly secured

### Manual Testing
1. **Start the server**: `python serve.py`
2. **Test identification**: Upload a cat photo via web interface
3. **Test admin endpoints**: Use curl commands with API key
4. **Verify no auto-registration**: Confirm new cats aren't added automatically

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **Out of Memory**: Reduce batch size in `config_siamese.py`
2. **Slow Training**: Use GPU or reduce image size
3. **Import Errors**: Ensure all dependencies are installed
4. **Dataset Issues**: Check folder structure and image formats
5. **Evaluation Failures**: Triplet model evaluation may fail (known issue)
6. **Port Conflicts**: If port 5000 is in use, use `PORT=5001 python serve.py`

### GPU Setup:
```bash
# Check GPU availability
nvidia-smi

# Install GPU version of TensorFlow (if needed)
pip install tensorflow-gpu
```

## System Security & Registration Policy

### No Auto-Registration Policy
The system is designed with a **strict no-auto-registration policy** to prevent database pollution and ensure data quality:

- **Identification Only**: The system only performs identification against previously registered cats
- **Auto-Registration Disabled**: New cats are never automatically added to the database
- **Admin Authorization Required**: Only authorized personnel can register new cats
- **TNR Compliance**: Registration requires completion of Trap-Neuter-Return procedures
- **Data Quality Control**: Prevents duplicate registrations and ensures proper documentation

### Security Features
- **API Key Authentication**: Administrative endpoints require valid API keys
- **File Size Limits**: Uploads limited to 10MB to prevent abuse
- **Input Validation**: All inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Audit Trail**: All administrative actions are logged with timestamps

### Registration Workflow
1. **TNR Process**: Cat must complete Trap-Neuter-Return procedures
2. **Photo Documentation**: Clear photos from multiple angles required
3. **Admin Review**: Authorized personnel review and approve registration
4. **Database Entry**: Cat is manually registered with proper documentation
5. **Verification**: System verifies registration and creates embeddings

## Key Functional Requirements

- Account creation with verification (FR-1, FR-4)
- Photo upload and Re-ID results with confidence scores (FR-7, FR-8)
- View, add, edit, delete cat profiles (FR-9, FR-10, FR-11)
- Role-based access and logging (FR-15)
- Admin analytics and match management (FR-13, FR-14)

## Non-Functional Highlights

- Mobile-first design with responsive layouts and offline sync.
- Visual accessibility (WCAG 2.2 AA) and performance optimizations.
- Secure session management and encryption (TLS, AES-256).
- Data privacy and GDPR/Japanese compliance.
- Disaster resilience and eco-friendly cloud architecture.
